# PacMan

This is a simple PacMan game where you can add as many PacMan images as you wish on the web browser by clicking an "Add PacMan" button. Once you've added your desired number of PacMan, you can click the "Start Game" button, and the PacMan will move around the window, bouncing off the edges and each other.

This game was made as a project during the MIT xPro coding bootcamp.

<b>Future Improvements</b>
<p>I will update the page's style to match the other projects. I would like to add a PacMan counter and a function where the PacMen change the direction they face when they change directions.</p>
